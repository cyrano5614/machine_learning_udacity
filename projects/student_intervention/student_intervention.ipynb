    "    Just like many other classification algorithm, SVM attempts to seperate the two classes with a boundary between them.  SVM creates the boundary right between the middle of the points that are closest to the boundary from both of the classes.  These points are called Support Vectors and hence the name Support Vector Machine.  It does not take a rocket scientist to realize the boundary needs to be right in the middle of those points for the SVM to have the biggest margin which is what SVM works to find.  In an ideal world, the decision boundary will split the data cleanly to classify, but this does not happen often.  This is where the \"kernel trick\" comes into play by transforming data points and seperating so it can be seperated in clean straight line or in higher dimension, hyperplane.  \n",
